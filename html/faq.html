 Dr. Bernard Luskin, recently retired Chancellor of Ventura Community College District will guide curriculum and California Community College relationships for our team.
W​e intend to offer dual credit and community based learning college classes to students engaged with our program at each of the participating universities.


Uplifting disadvantaged communities

 Creating jobs

Our ecosystem allows for many different possibilities, We will have opportunities for employment building towards to production of​ ​millworks, design, manufacturing & producing wood products, crafting furniture and structures, and laying community raised bed gardens

Job training

In addition to creating jobs, our partnerships with local state and community colleges and youth development centers will provide opportunities for job training and professional mentorship in each of our project areas.

Safe, Mobile, Creative learning Spaces

Our approach turns almost any place into a learning environment. The Smart Kids Initiative employs the community in making it better.We recreate the idea of a community as a village, where every student has a sense of purposeful inclusion in their community. We want to provide learning spaces that provide learners the opportunity to ask meaningful questions, seek and test solutions regarding the vital needs of, community.

Even before COVID-19, low-income urban and rural areas of the US experienced limited access to affordable school programs, consistent internet access, and computer resources. The SMART Kids Initiative is an eco-friendly, cost-effective, workable and scalable solution in a time where mobile learning space is more important than ever. The SMART Kids initiative comprises of a combination of technologies and resources that create small group after school programs, homework help, internships, work experience across a spectrum of ages and skill levels in disadvantaged Fresno neighborhoods first, spreading next to Madera and ​Reedley College, Madera Community College Center, Oakhurst Community College Center, Fresno City College and Clovis Community College. ​San Francisco, then throughout California, and under resourced neighborhoods across the United States.


We want to restore the feeling of school as an inspiring, creative environment.​ ​The venue will be vetted by the school, parents and community. We will host learning spaces in creative locations where youth will be inspired to visit and also these can change weekly or even daily since setup and take down efforts are at a minimum​.

We plan to partner with locally owned restaurants as study spaces, many of whom are struggling to stay afloat due to halted or reduced revenue after the onset of COVID-19. We would have small groups of students come in on a scaled schedule, using proper social distancing and hygiene practices. No set-up would be required of the restaurant since each student would bring their technology kit, equipt with their own personal lightweight desk and computer. We would pay the restaurant to supply snacks for the students, thereby ensuring that the business has a consistent customer base, and the students have something to eat.

Characteristics of the learning spaces should directly reflect specific group learning objectives and require further discussion. Each kit works for groups of four to twelve people depending on space, needs and roles. Assigning individual responsibilities on the team provides a wide range of options to tap the unique talents and learning style of each student.

The offering includes teams of small groups numbering four to twelve persons each. Every team is resourced with a complete technology kit, including computer workstations and desks all in their own carrying cases (total weight under 70 lbs.) that set up in minutes and cost between $1,100 – $2,500, pricing subject to volume. This offering provides significant benefit to youth in disadvantaged communities across the area. In providing academic objectives w/ stipend, along with an opportunity to learn skills that lead to more self-reliance, develop self-confidence and steer them away from dangerous influences such as alcohol and drugs.

Mentorship opportunities

Community Partners

We will host and receive referrals for

students from the following community partners

●  Vance Child Care Center

●  Vance Middle School

●  BTW High School

●  McKinley Elementary School

●  LeMoyne Owen College

●  Memphis Hope / Women’s Foundation

●  Memphis House Authority

●  Boys and Girls Club

●  Vance Community Development Corporation

●  Area Child Care Center

●  Foote Homes

●  Local Places of Worship

        Students will have the opportunity to advance their
leadership potential and become a peer mentor over time. We will also allow admin at our community sites to make referrals for peer mentors who are new to the program. In addition to mentorship roles, we will have opportunities for older students to become instructors for younger students, with high school instructing middle school, college students instructing high school students, and professional volunteers offering instruction periodically.

GreenHouse Gas Sequestration in Mill Work

Mitigating Wildfires, Reducing the Digital Divide- a Win-Win

There are rare times when problems and solutions stare each other in the face. Such is the case here. California mitigation efforts include grant funding to improve forest health along with biomass and urban forestry wood utilization which lift disadvantaged communities in California at the same time. Our goal is high utilization of emergency zone beetle killed pine to create jobs, job training, and provide a variety of highly marketable wood products using urban forestry techniques.We plan to facilitate intergenerational ecological education and collaborative work from professional and senior volunteers, work study students, and youth mentors. This projects directly assists Cal Fire sequestration of carbon effort by removing down trees near roadways in the emergency zone and giving them second lives as high-quality work-desks for students who would not otherwise have a study space at home.We hope to communicate to the interrelatedness of environmental preservation and quality of life.. Project takes direct action to achieve and maintain a net reduction in GHG emissions over a 10 year period based on partner agreements and operations. Project combines the operations of a sawmill providing lumber, CNC fabrication, CLT, LVL, LSL beam manufacturing, along with our teams existing US design patents for furniture and structures into usable products for people of the Stockton (Seaport) community first, then through our various networks to individuals and entities around the world in need of structures and furniture.

Zero Emissions: ​Greenhouse Gas Reduction

​Forest health is important to us! That’s why we don’t just reduce carbon by keeping trees from starting wildfires, we also maximize use of the trees to run a zero-emissions operation.

 As a ​zero emissions operation​ we are partnering with All Power labs, a manufacturer of biomass gasification electricity generation equipment. We transform sawmill waste and residual branches and bush from the pine after production into biomass fuel. Biomass created of material from emergency zones will power our millworks plant.
VIA trucks will be leased and equipped for field operations which power portable sawmills to emergency zone worksite scheduled
Trucks provide site power for electric chainsaws, charge batteries for portable electric saws and team requirements.
Our facility will further our goals of carbon reduction and food justice through our 720 square foot Green wall. The Green Wall will provide clean oxygen indoors with an effect equivalent to 16 fourteen-foot-tall trees.

Our Urban forestry operation will require a F650 min. equipped form factory for clean burning fuel option. This vehicle will operate by liquid natural gas (LNG) or Propane gas. Both are zero emission solutions.

Our team member participants initially will initially sell furniture at reduced cost which covers milling and manufacturing. Log acquisition, millwork, design, manufacturing, tree planting all conducted with teams, each role brings teaching and learning with connected accountability.
 We will ship completed structures by container or rail car.

Tree- Planting: Creating Ecologically Diverse Green-Space

Outreach and community by-in is vital; therefore; we will be partnering with local television stations to announce tree plantings, community gardening events, and other efforts.
Every tree we plant will carry RFID chips to document carbon capture, report, monitor data points & track growth Building Community.
When a seed is planted in it’s biodegradable pot at the company's nursery, it will be accompanied by an RFID tag encoded with a unique ID number linked to the date and information about its mother tree.
In that way, when the trees are planted, the staff has a record of each sapling's lineage and can thus ensure they do not exclusively plant trees from a single mother tree in one area, which would reduce the forest's diversity and, therefore, the general health of the trees within it.
The tags, which comply with the EPC Gen 2 standard, are read using a Convergence Systems CS101 handheld interrogator, and the data is then transmitted from the handheld reader to the company's back-end system via a Wi-Fi connection.
That data is saved on HLH's Web-based database, using software the firm developed itself.

 Ecological education.
Ecology education is tied into every piece of our programming, however, we also plan to provide Community Based Learning, work-study, and internship opportunities to Reedley College Forestry students to give them practical experience in their field, and build a base of skilled professionals who could potentially help sustain our operations post-graduation.
Urban forestry is social forestry. Our team views this as an opportunity to demonstrate the mathematics and geometry of doing more with less materials and effort. We are applying the accumulated knowledge of how to build in harmony with nature using its design of natural structure processes as a guide. Ecology education includes planting trees, green walls, and designing and building vegetable gardens to provide fresh food to the community. The core of our project is California Community Colleges which serve Fresno, Madera, and San Francisco.
